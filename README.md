# Data Engineering Notes

This repository accompanies my writing on Substack/LinkedIn, where I share real-world experiences from my journey as a Data Engineer.

The focus here is **not on tutorials, cheat-sheets or exhaustive how-to guides**, but on:
- How data pipelines are actually built and evolved in production
- Design decisions, trade-offs, and constraints
- Lessons learned from traditional ETL systems to modern data platforms
- Code snippets and small experiments referenced in articles
- Personal side projects that explore data engineering concepts hands-on

## Why this repository exists

Most data engineering content online explains *what* to do.

This repository exists to capture **why things were done a certain way**, **what worked**, **what didn’t**, and **how constraints shaped the final system** — especially in regulated, real-world environments like banking and insurance.

## What you’ll find here

- 📄 **Article References**  
  Code snippets and examples mentioned in Substack/LinkedIn articles

- 🧪 **Experiments**  
  Small, focused explorations (formats, performance, modeling, tooling)

- 🏗️ **Mini Projects**  
  End-to-end pipelines, schemas, or system designs built for learning

- 📝 **Notes & Diagrams**  
  Architecture notes, data models, and design explanations

## What you won’t find here

- Step-by-step beginner tutorials
- Copy-paste production-ready frameworks
- Over-engineered abstractions without context

## Who this is for

- Data Engineers who enjoy understanding **systems, not just tools**
- Engineers transitioning from traditional ETL to modern data platforms
- Anyone curious about how real data pipelines evolve over time
